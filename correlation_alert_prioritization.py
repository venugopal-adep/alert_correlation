            <h3>Understanding Alert Prioritization</h3>
            <p>Alert Prioritization in AIOps helps IT teams focus on the most critical issues first. The heatmap above visualizes alert frequency across services and severities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each row represents a service</li>
                <li>Each column represents a severity level</li>
                <li>The color intensity indicates the number of alerts (darker = more alerts)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Imagine you're managing a large e-commerce platform. The heatmap might show:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Database service with many critical alerts: This could indicate persistent performance issues affecting the entire platform.</li>
                <li>Payment service with a mix of high and medium alerts: This might suggest intermittent issues that need attention to ensure smooth transactions.</li>
                <li>Logging service with mostly low severity alerts: While important, these might be less urgent compared to the database and payment issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Priority Score helps quantify which services need immediate attention. It's calculated by weighting alerts based on their severity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Critical alerts are weighted 4x</li>
                <li>High alerts are weighted 3x</li>
                <li>Medium alerts are weighted 2x</li>
                <li>Low alerts are weighted 1x</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This approach ensures that services with more severe alerts are prioritized, helping teams tackle the most impactful issues first.</p>

    This interactive demo was created to illustrate the concept of Alert Prioritization in AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations).

    Key features:
    1. Simulates alert generation across multiple services with varying severities
    2. Visualizes alerts over time
    3. Implements a basic alert prioritization system using a heatmap and priority scores
    4. Provides an educational component with a quiz

    The demo is meant for educational purposes and simulates a simplified version of alert prioritization. In real-world scenarios, more complex algorithms, additional factors, and domain-specific knowledge would be considered.

    For more information on AIOps and alert prioritization, please refer to academic papers and industry resources on these topics.

    1. Implement machine learning models to predict alert severity and prioritize based on likely impact

    3. Incorporate historical data to identify patterns and recurring issues
    4. Add user feedback mechanisms to improve prioritization over time
    5. Integrate with real-time data sources for live alert prioritization
